        <h1>SCP-5234</h1>
        <h2>Object Class: Keter</h2>
        <h2>Special Containment Procedures:</h2>
        <p>SCP-5234 is to be contained in a reinforced, soundproof containment chamber measuring 10m x 10m x 10m at Site-██. The chamber must be lined with Scranton Reality Anchors (SRAs) to prevent dimensional breaches. SCP-5234 is to be monitored by no fewer than three security personnel at all times, with additional guards stationed at all access points to the containment area.</p>
        <p>Access to SCP-5234 is restricted to Level 4 personnel or higher. All personnel entering the containment area must undergo psychological evaluation and wear Class-V memetic resistance gear. Interaction with SCP-5234 is strictly prohibited unless for approved research purposes.</p>
        
        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>SCP-5234, referred to as "Evil Sans," is an anomalous entity that bears a striking resemblance to the character Sans from the video game <em>Undertale</em>, albeit with significant deviations in appearance and behavior. SCP-5234 stands approximately 1.5 meters tall and is composed of a dark, shadow-like substance that absorbs light, creating a silhouette effect.</p>
        <p>The entity’s facial features include one eye socket being completely void of light, while the other emits a red and blue glow. SCP-5234 wears a tattered hoodie, black pants, and a red scarf. Its mouth is twisted into a perpetual grin, revealing sharp, unsettling teeth. The entity’s speech is characterized by distorted, often mocking tones, frequently accompanied by a sinister smile.</p>
        <p>SCP-5234 displays highly aggressive and malevolent behavior, with a strong tendency to inflict psychological and physical harm on any living being it encounters. It possesses the ability to manipulate reality within a 5-meter radius, altering physical properties and inducing severe psychological distress. The entity has demonstrated a particular penchant for exploiting the fears and regrets of its victims, taunting them with deeply personal knowledge.</p>
        <p>SCP-5234 is capable of emitting a high-pitched, distorted sound that causes intense headaches, disorientation, and hallucinations in those exposed. Prolonged exposure to this sound has led to instances of psychosis and, in extreme cases, suicide. This sound is believed to contain memetic properties that contribute to SCP-5234's reality-warping abilities.</p>

        <!-- New Text: Characteristics -->
        <h2>Characteristics:</h2>
        <p>Despite its outward appearance resembling a skeletal figure, SCP-5234's internal structure is vastly different from any known biological entity. Preliminary analysis suggests that SCP-5234 is composed of an unknown, highly dense material that can withstand extreme physical and energy-based attacks. Its "bones" appear to be flexible and capable of rapid regeneration.</p>
        <p>Interestingly, SCP-5234 exhibits an ability to alter its form and size to an extent, allowing it to squeeze through narrow spaces or appear more menacing when confronted. This shapeshifting ability is believed to be linked to its reality manipulation capabilities.</p>

        <div class="addendum">
            <p>A recent visual capture of SCP-5234 depicts the entity standing in a hunched posture, with a wide, malicious grin and a speech bubble reading "Nah, I’d blast." The entity’s eyes exhibit the distinct red and blue glow characteristic of its anomalous properties. The image serves as a crucial reference for identifying SCP-5234 during encounters and containment operations.</p>

            <div class="log-entry">
                <p><strong>Experiment 5234-C1:</strong> Subject D-3456 was exposed to SCP-5234 for 10 minutes.</p>
                <p><strong>Results:</strong> Subject exhibited severe paranoia and auditory hallucinations. Terminated after attempting to harm personnel. Post-mortem examination revealed extensive brain tissue damage consistent with prolonged exposure to high-frequency sound waves.</p>
                <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> SCP-5234's psychological effects are severe and require further study to understand the mechanisms involved. Enhanced memetic defenses are recommended for all personnel involved in SCP-5234 research.</p>

                <p><strong>Experiment 5234-C2:</strong> Subject D-7891 was introduced into SCP-5234’s containment chamber with an audio recording device to document SCP-5234’s interactions.</p>
                <p><strong>Results:</strong> SCP-5234 immediately displayed hostility, emitting a low-frequency sound that incapacitated the subject. Subject exhibited symptoms of acute stress disorder and was unable to communicate coherently after retrieval. Subject later reported vivid hallucinations involving personal fears and childhood memories.</p>
                <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> SCP-5234 appears to target and amplify individual psychological vulnerabilities, using them to induce mental breakdowns in subjects. Further study is needed to understand the selection criteria and mechanisms behind SCP-5234's targeting process.</p>

                <p><strong>Experiment 5234-C3:</strong> Remote-operated drone equipped with sensory and audio recording equipment was sent into SCP-5234’s containment chamber to analyze environmental changes.</p>
                <p><strong>Results:</strong> The drone recorded significant fluctuations in spatial geometry, with the chamber appearing to expand and contract erratically. SCP-5234’s presence seemed to destabilize the physical structure of the chamber, creating a visually and audibly chaotic environment. Drone lost functionality after 5 minutes due to severe interference, presumed to be caused by SCP-5234's anomalous effects.</p>
                <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> SCP-5234 can affect physical space on a fundamental level, suggesting its abilities extend beyond psychological manipulation. Further containment measures are needed to stabilize the containment chamber and prevent breaches.</p>

        <h2>Addendum 5234-6: Incident Report 5234-B</h2>
        <div class="addendum">
            <p>On [DATE REDACTED], SCP-5234 initiated a containment breach attempt by manifesting an unknown force field that disrupted electronic security systems and created a temporal distortion within the containment area. Security personnel reported experiencing disorienting temporal loops and visual hallucinations of past and future events.</p>
            <p>After approximately ██ minutes, SCP-5234 managed to breach the initial containment perimeter, causing extensive damage to Site-██ infrastructure. SCP-5234 was eventually re-contained by Mobile Task Force Theta-13 ("Reality Benders"), utilizing specialized temporal stabilization equipment. Casualties included ██ personnel, with several others requiring extensive psychological debriefing and therapy.</p>
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> Enhanced temporal and spatial stabilization protocols have been implemented to prevent future breach attempts and mitigate SCP-5234’s reality-altering capabilities.</p>
