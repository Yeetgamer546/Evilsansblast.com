        <h1>SCP-5234</h1>
        <h2>Object Class: Keter</h2>
        <h2>Special Containment Procedures:</h2>
        <p>SCP-5234 is to be contained in a reinforced, soundproof containment chamber measuring 10m x 10m x 10m at Site-██. The chamber must be lined with Scranton Reality Anchors (SRAs) to prevent dimensional breaches. SCP-5234 is to be monitored by no fewer than three security personnel at all times, with additional guards stationed at all access points to the containment area.</p>
        <p>Access to SCP-5234 is restricted to Level 4 personnel or higher. All personnel entering the containment area must undergo psychological evaluation and wear Class-V memetic resistance gear. Interaction with SCP-5234 is strictly prohibited unless for approved research purposes.</p>
        
        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>SCP-5234, referred to as "Evil Sans," is an anomalous entity that bears a striking resemblance to the character Sans from the video game <em>Undertale</em>, albeit with significant deviations in appearance and behavior. SCP-5234 stands approximately 1.5 meters tall and is composed of a dark, shadow-like substance that absorbs light, creating a silhouette effect.</p>
        <p>The entity’s facial features include one eye socket being completely void of light, while the other emits a red and blue glow. SCP-5234 wears a tattered hoodie, black pants, and a red scarf. Its mouth is twisted into a perpetual grin, revealing sharp, unsettling teeth. The entity’s speech is characterized by distorted, often mocking tones, frequently accompanied by a sinister smile.</p>
        <p>SCP-5234 displays highly aggressive and malevolent behavior, with a strong tendency to inflict psychological and physical harm on any living being it encounters. It possesses the ability to manipulate reality within a 5-meter radius, altering physical properties and inducing severe psychological distress. The entity has demonstrated a particular penchant for exploiting the fears and regrets of its victims, taunting them with deeply personal knowledge.</p>
        <p>SCP-5234 is capable of emitting a high-pitched, distorted sound that causes intense headaches, disorientation, and hallucinations in those exposed. Prolonged exposure to this sound has led to instances of psychosis and, in extreme cases, suicide. This sound is believed to contain memetic properties that contribute to SCP-5234's reality-warping abilities.</p>
        
        <h2>Addendum 5234-1: Discovery</h2>
        <div class="addendum">
            <p>SCP-5234 was discovered in ███████, [REDACTED], following a series of unexplained disappearances and reports of an "evil shadow" terrorizing the area. Mobile Task Force Eta-10 ("See No Evil") was dispatched to investigate and successfully contained the entity, albeit with significant casualties.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Addendum 5234-2: Incident Report 5234-A</h2>
        <div class="addendum">
            <p>On [DATE REDACTED], SCP-5234 breached containment, resulting in the deaths of ██ personnel. The breach occurred during a routine security check when SCP-5234 emitted an undocumented frequency that disabled electronic equipment and rendered security personnel unconscious. SCP-5234 was re-contained after ██ hours of pursuit and several confrontations, necessitating the deployment of Mobile Task Force Nu-7 ("Hammer Down").</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Researcher's Note:</h2>
        <p>Efforts are ongoing to understand the full extent of SCP-5234's abilities and origins. Preliminary data suggests a possible connection to digital anomalies or a crossover event involving parallel dimensions. Further research is required to determine the precise nature of SCP-5234 and develop more effective containment strategies.</p>

        <h2>Addendum 5234-3: Visual Documentation</h2>
        <img src="file:///mnt/data/nahidblast.png" alt="SCP-5234">
        <div class="addendum">
            <p>A recent visual capture of SCP-5234 depicts the entity standing in a hunched posture, with a wide, malicious grin and a speech bubble reading "Nah, I’d blast." The entity’s eyes exhibit the distinct red and blue glow characteristic of its anomalous properties. The image serves as a crucial reference for identifying SCP-5234 during encounters and containment operations.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Addendum 5234-4: Audio Log 5234-B</h2>
        <div class="addendum">
            <p><strong><em><Begin Log></em></strong></p>
            <p><strong>Dr. ██████:</strong> "This is Dr. ██████, recording audio log 5234-B. We are attempting a controlled interaction with SCP-5234."</p>
            <p><strong>[Static and distortion]</strong></p>
            <p><strong>SCP-5234:</strong> "Heh, heh, heh... You think you can contain me? I'm everywhere and nowhere, doctor. I'll find you, and when I do, you'll regret ever crossing paths with Evil Sans."</p>
            <p><strong>Dr. ██████:</strong> "Noted. Terminate the recording."</p>
            <p><strong><em><End Log></em></strong></p>
        </div>

        <h2>Note:</h2>
        <p>All future interactions with SCP-5234 are to be conducted remotely via automated systems to minimize risk to personnel.</p>

        <h2>Addendum 5234-5: Experiment Log 5234-C</h2>
        <div class="addendum">
            <p><strong>Experiment 5234-C1:</strong> Subject D-3456 was exposed to SCP-5234 for 10 minutes.</p>
            <p><strong>Results:</strong> Subject exhibited severe paranoia and auditory hallucinations. Terminated after attempting to harm personnel. Post-mortem examination revealed extensive brain tissue damage consistent with prolonged exposure to high-frequency sound waves.</p>
            <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> SCP-5234's psychological effects are severe and require further study to understand the mechanisms involved. Enhanced memetic defenses are recommended for all personnel involved in SCP-5234 research.</p>
